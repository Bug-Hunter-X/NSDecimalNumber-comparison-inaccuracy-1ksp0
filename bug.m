In Objective-C, a subtle bug can occur when dealing with `NSDecimalNumber` and comparing its values using `isEqualToNumber:` method.  If you are comparing `NSDecimalNumber` objects created from floating-point numbers (like `float` or `double`), slight inaccuracies in floating-point representation can lead to unexpected results.  Even if the numbers appear to be identical when printed, the underlying decimal representation might differ at a very low level. This makes the comparison using `isEqualToNumber:` to return `NO` even if mathematically the numbers are equal.
